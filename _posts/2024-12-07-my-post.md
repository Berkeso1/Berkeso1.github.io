## Introduction

During this lab, my goal was to query the World Bank API and extract values such as the population and GDP per capita of a country. Initially, I was tasked with querying the World Bank API for the life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population of a country. However, I expanded upon these indicators and also decided to query the API for several other indicators, such as labor force, government expenditure on education, food production index, population growth, and access to electricity. I didn't just randomly choose these indicators, though. I chose to look into the labor force as it is an important part of a country's economy and ability to produce, I chose to look into government expenditure on education as this is a key factor in determining if the population is educated or not, I chose to look into the food production index as it can tell me if the country has a strong agricultural output, I chose to look into population growth as it is an important indicator in determining if a country is growing, and lastly, I chose to look into a country's access to electricity as this can determine if a country is impoverished, or underdeveloped. These are all important things to look at when trying to understand a country's economic or general state.

# Filtering

### Countries

There are a lot of countries to query in the World Bank API, however not all of the country's have the data for the indicators you choose. Some NA's will occasionally appear in your data, however its not the end of the world. Personally, I did not filter out the country's that had NA for some of the indicators I chose as that would decrease the size of my dataset drastically, however if you wanted to really clean the data you produce you could filter out any countrys that have an NA for a given indicator. This can be done as shown:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

cleaned_df = df.dropna()

cleaned_df.to_csv('cleaned_file.csv', index=False)
print(cleaned_df)
```
By doing this to your data, you will get rid of any country's that returned NA for any of your indicators.

If you dont want to make a CSV for all the data you have extracted, you can also just go into the get_all_countries method and add a parameter that will exclude any countries you chose. You can make a list of countries you would like to exclude. This can be done by adding the following code:

```python
def get_all_countries():
        exclude_countries = ["Albania", "Afghanistan"]  
        BASE_URL = "http://api.worldbank.org/v2/country"
        params = {
            "format": "json",
            "per_page": 300
        }
        response = requests.get(BASE_URL, params=params)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            if data and len(data) > 1:
                return [
                    {"name": country["name"], "iso3": country["id"]}
                    for country in data[1]
                    if country["region"]["value"] != "Aggregates" and
                        (exclude_countries is None or country["name"] not in exclude_countries)
                ]
        return []
```

This should exclude any countries you want.

### Years

I did not find the need to filter out any of the years
