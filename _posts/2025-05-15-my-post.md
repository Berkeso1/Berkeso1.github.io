## Why This Project?

As a competitive rower, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by what actually makes someone fast on the erg. Is it raw wattage? Stroke rate? Lactic acid buildup? Heart rate recovery? I wanted to go beyond surface-level stats and dive into the *data behind the performance*.

Thatâ€™s where this project began. I wasnâ€™t satisfied with just seeing my own times and wondering what could make them better. I wanted to look at my whole team â€” 15 to 20 rowers â€” and use the tools of data science to find *what really matters*. 

The goal? To uncover the physiological and mechanical factors that most influence rowing performance. Along the way, Iâ€™ll be experimenting with plots, statistical models, and maybe even some unexpected findings.

## The Data

To start, I collected data from rowing machines â€” ergs â€” used by our team during workouts. These machines track a wealth of variables: power output (watts), force curves, stroke rate, heart rate, and even sometimes lactic acid levels. I also collected times and split data over intervals to capture how performance changes over the course of a piece.

All the raw data lives in a shared Google Spreadsheet, which I update as I collect more logs:

Iâ€™ll also be using [Rowsandall.com](https://rowsandall.com) â€” a powerful rowing analytics platform â€” to help crunch some of the numbers and visualize performance trends.

The dataset isnâ€™t huge, but itâ€™s rich. And I believe itâ€™s enough to surface meaningful insights about which factors correlate most with success on the erg and â€” eventually â€” on the water.

Stay tuned. The results might surprise you.
