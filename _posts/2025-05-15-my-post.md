## Why This Project?

As a competitive rower, I’ve always been fascinated by what actually makes someone fast on the erg. Is it raw wattage? Stroke rate? Lactic acid buildup? Heart rate recovery? I wanted to go beyond surface-level stats and dive into the *data behind the performance*.

That’s where this project began. I wasn’t satisfied with just seeing my own times and wondering what could make them better. I wanted to look at my whole team (60+ rowers, but I will only look at around 15-20) and use the tools of data science to find *what really matters*. 

The goal? To uncover the physiological and mechanical factors that influence rowing performance the most. Along the way, I’ll be experimenting with various plots (seaborn and matplotlib libraries), statistical models, and maybe even some unexpected findings.

## The Data

To start, I collected data from rowing machines (ergometers or erg for short) used by our team during workouts. These machines track a bunch of variables: power output (watts), force curves, stroke rate, heart rate, and even sometimes lactic acid levels. I also collected times and split data (a split is defined as how long it takes you to complete 500 meters) over intervals to capture how performance changes over the course of a piece.

All the raw data lives in a shared Google Spreadsheet, which I update as I collect more logs:

I’ll also be using [Rowsandall.com](https://rowsandall.com) a powerful rowing analytics platform to help crunch some of the numbers and visualize performance trends.

The dataset isn’t huge, but it contains a lot of interesting parameters. And I believe it’s enough to find meaningful insights about which factors correlate most with success on the erg and eventually on the water.
