## Why This Project?

As a competitive rower, I’ve always been curious about what truly drives performance improvements on the ergometer. Is it purely the ability to generate higher wattage through muscular strength? Or perhaps optimizing heart efficiency through targeted heart rate training? This project aims to investigate these two primary factors deeply using data science techniques.

Specifically the project is structured around two main hypothesis:

1. Strength Training Impact: Engaging in compound exercises like squat variants, hex-bar deadlifts, and bent-over rows significantly increases overall strength. As rowers become stronger their ability to produce higher wattage should increase linearly, improving performance across sprints, steady-state sessions, and standardized tests like the 2k and 6k.

2. Heart Rate Training Effect: Consistently maintaining lower heart rates (140-150 bpm) during steady-state training sessions will enhance cardiovascular efficiency. This training adaptation should lead to reduced heart rates during high-intensity workouts, allowing rowers to maintain higher performance levels by preventing the sharp performance drops that accompany extremely high heart rates.


## The Data

To begin, I gathered data directly from rowing machines (ergometers, or "ergs") used by our team during workouts. These machines record several key variables, including power output (watts), force curves, stroke rate, heart rate, and occasionally lactic acid levels. Additionally, I tracked interval times and split data—where a "split" refers to the time it takes to complete 500 meters—to analyze how performance evolves throughout each workout session.

To enhance the accuracy and depth of my analysis, I reached out to several teammates and friends, asking them to perform specific rowing sessions: 500-meter sprint pieces and steady-state workouts. Immediately after each session, they reported their results to me in a structured format [watts, stroke rate, heart rate]. I then compiled this data into individual CSV files for each friend, ensuring careful organization and easy access. While each dataset may not appear extensive, every data point was carefully recorded right after each workout, capturing genuine, real-time performance metrics. This process enabled me to build a precise and valuable foundation for my analysis.

All the raw data lives in my github repository: https://github.com/Berkeso1/Rowing-Performance

## Data Visualizations and Insights

To effectively communicate the results and validate my hypotheses, I created several visualizations using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib. The visualizations include:

- Strength Training Correlations: Scatter plots clearly illustrating the correlation between increased compound lift weights and average wattage outputs, as well as improved 500m sprint times.

- Heart Rate Training Correlations: Regression plots demonstrating the relationship between steady-state heart rate levels and improvements in both average wattage and sprint times.

These visualizations not only help to illustrate clear patterns and correlations but also allow my teammates and coaches to intuitively grasp the practical benefits of targeted training methods. The visual insights strongly support the idea that disciplined training—whether strength-focused or heart-rate-based—can lead directly to measurable improvements in rowing performance.

## Real-Life Evidence: Oliver's Success Story

A significant validation of the heart rate training hypothesis is demonstrated through my teammate Oliver’s recent achievement. After several months of dedicated low-intensity steady-state training, Oliver recently completed a 2k ergometer test, setting a new personal record by improving his previous best (6:46) by an impressive 10 seconds (now 6:36). Furthermore Oliver was able to sustain significantly higher stroke rates (36 spm) throughout his 2k performance which is a result of being able to maintain a lower heart rate. This substantial improvement highlights the direct impact of disciplined heart rate training, reinforcing the hypothesis that improved cardiovascular efficiency translates directly into superior rowing performance.
