## Analyzing Factors Influencing Student Performance

### Dataset Overview
The dataset I analyzed, titled **Student Performance Factors**, explores various attributes influencing academic performance in students. It includes variables like parental involvement, hours studied, sleep hours, teacher quality, and exam scores. I sourced this dataset from a public education repository available online.

### Focus of the Analysis
I was particularly interested in understanding how key factors such as **hours studied**, **sleep hours**, and **parental involvement** influence **exam scores**. My goal was to draw insights about the relationships between these variables and highlight patterns that may affect student performance.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
Before diving into the analysis, I cleaned the dataset by removing rows with missing values and mapping categorical data to numerical formats for easier analysis. For instance:

**Removing Missing Values**: Rows with missing or incomplete data were dropped to avoid skewed results during analysis. For example:

 ```Python
   data_cleaned = data.dropna()
```

**Mapping Categorical Variables to Numeric Values**: Many columns in the dataset contained categorical data such as "Low," "Medium," and "High," which needed to be converted into numerical values for analysis.
I used mapping dictionaries to assign meaningful numerical equivalents. For example:

```Python
level_mapping = {'Low': 1, 'Medium': 2, 'High': 3}
data_cleaned['Parental_Involvement_#'] = data_cleaned['Parental_Involvement'].map(level_mapping)
data_cleaned['Motivation_Level_#'] = data_cleaned['Motivation_Level'].map(level_mapping)
```

This process was repeated for other categorical columns, such as Teacher Quality and Peer Influence.

**Binary Conversion for Yes/No Columns**: Columns such as "Internet Access" and "Learning Disabilities" were converted to binary values:

```Python
yes_no_mapping = {'No': 0, 'Yes': 1}
data_cleaned['Internet_Access_#'] = data_cleaned['Internet_Access'].map(yes_no_mapping)
data_cleaned['Learning_Disabilities_#'] = data_cleaned['Learning_Disabilities'].map(yes_no_mapping)
```

**Gender Encoding**: To facilitate comparisons between male and female students, I mapped genders to binary values:

```Python
gender_mapping = {'Male': 0, 'Female': 1}
data_cleaned['Gender_#'] = data_cleaned['Gender'].map(gender_mapping)
```

**Standardizing Column Names**: New columns with mapped values were suffixed with "_#", making it easier to distinguish between original and transformed data. For example:

Parental_Involvement was converted to Parental_Involvement_# and Teacher_Quality was converted to Teacher_Quality_#.

### Variables Analyzed

During this lab I decided to analyze the following variables:

1. **Hours Studied**: The amount of time students dedicate to studying each day.
2. **Sleep Hours**: Daily sleep duration, which plays a critical role in cognitive function and overall academic performance.
3. **Exam Scores**: Performance in academic assessments, measured on a numerical scale, which serves as the dependent variable in the analysis.
4. **Parental Education**: The highest level of education attained by the student's parents, which is often correlated with academic support at home.
5. **Gender**: The gender of the student, included to explore any potential disparities in academic performance.
6. **Extracurricular Activities**: Participation in school-related or external activities, which may impact time management and overall performance.

## Key Findings

### Summary Statistics

The summary statistics provided insights into central tendencies and variability:

```python
# Key variables for summary statistics
variables = [
    'Hours_Studied', 'Sleep_Hours', 'Exam_Score',
    'Parental_Involvement_#', 'Motivation_Level_#',
    'Extracurricular_Activities_#', 'Gender_#'
]

# Summary statistics
summary_stats = data_cleaned[variables].describe().T
summary_stats['IQR'] = summary_stats['75%'] - summary_stats['25%']  # Calculate interquartile range
print(summary_stats)
```

Key observations from the summary statistics:

**Hours Studied**:

- Range: 1 to 8 hours per day.
- Median: 4 hours.
- Standard Deviation (Std. Dev.): Moderate variability, indicating a spread of study habits among students.

**Sleep Hours**:

- Mean: 7 hours.
- Std. Dev.: Relatively low, showing most students sleep within a consistent range.

**Exam Scores**:

- Range: Scores vary widely, highlighting diverse performance levels.
- IQR: A large interquartile range suggests significant differences in scores between the 25th and 75th percentiles.

**Parental Involvement**:

- Mapped values: 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), 3 (High).
- Distribution: Most students reported Medium or High levels of involvement.

**Motivation Level**:

- Mapped values: 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), 3 (High).
- Center: Median motivation level is Medium, with a relatively balanced spread.
  
**Extracurricular Activities**:

- Binary: 0 (No), 1 (Yes).
- Mean: A mean value close to 0.5 suggests equal participation and non-participation rates.

**Gender**:

- Binary: 0 (Male), 1 (Female).
- Distribution: Roughly equal numbers of male and female students, based on the mean value.

### Relationships Between Variables

To understand how different factors influence student performance, I analyzed the relationships between key variables, 
such as **Hours Studied**, **Sleep Hours**, **Exam Scores**, and **Parental Involvement**. This analysis helped me find trends and potential correlations between variables.

1. **Hours Studied vs. Exam Scores**:
   A scatterplot revealed a **positive correlation** between hours studied and exam scores. Students who dedicated more time to studying generally performed better on exams. However, diminishing returns were observed for students studying more than six hours, indicating a potential plateau in the benefit of additional study time.

   ```python
   sns.scatterplot(data=data_cleaned, x='Hours_Studied', y='Exam_Score')
   plt.title('Hours Studied vs. Exam Scores')
   plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')
   plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
   plt.show()
   ```
2. **Sleep Hours vs. Exam Scores**:
   The relationship between sleep hours and exam scores showed a non-linear trend. Both insufficient (less than 5 hours) and excessive sleep (more than 9 hours) were associated with lower exam scores. Optimal performance was observed for students sleeping 6â€“8 hours.

  ```python
  sns.lineplot(data=data_cleaned, x='Sleep_Hours', y='Exam_Score', ci=None)
  plt.title('Sleep Hours vs. Exam Scores')
  plt.xlabel('Sleep Hours')
  plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
  plt.show()
  ```

3. **Parental Involvement and Exam Scores**:
   Students with higher parental involvement (mapped as 3) consistently achieved better exam scores than those with low or medium involvement. This highlights the role of parental support in academic success.
   
  ```python
  sns.boxplot(data=data_cleaned, x='Parental_Involvement_#', y='Exam_Score')
  plt.title('Parental Involvement vs. Exam Scores')
  plt.xlabel('Parental Involvement Level')
  plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
  plt.show()
  ```

4. **Gender and Exam Scores**:
   A comparison of exam scores by gender (binary variable: 0 for male, 1 for female) showed no significant difference in performance. This suggests that gender does not influence academic outcomes within this dataset.

  ```python
  sns.boxplot(data=data_cleaned, x='Gender_#', y='Exam_Score')
  plt.title('Gender vs. Exam Scores')
  plt.xlabel('Gender (0 = Male, 1 = Female)')
  plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
  plt.show()
  ```

5. **Extracurricular Activities and Exam Scores**:
   Students who participated in extracurricular activities (binary: 1 for Yes, 0 for No) performed slightly better on exams. However, the difference was not substantial, suggesting that extracurricular involvement might contribute indirectly through skills like time management.

  ```python
  sns.barplot(data=data_cleaned, x='Extracurricular_Activities_#', y='Exam_Score')
  plt.title('Extracurricular Activities vs. Exam Scores')
  plt.xlabel('Extracurricular Participation (0 = No, 1 = Yes)')
  plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
  plt.show()
  ```
